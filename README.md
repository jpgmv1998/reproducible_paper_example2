> IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: This is just an application of the Reproducible Paper Template. The analysis presented is just an illustration.

> IMPORTANT OBSERVATION: This README is written as if all data files were included in the replication package. However, because GitHub has a hard limit of 100 Mb for individual files, it was impossible to include all data files. If you want a complete version (including all data files), see the repository uploaded at Zenodo [@vieira2023example].


Overview
--------

The code in this replication package cleans the raw data for each data source (4 sources), constructs the samples for analysis, and generates the results using R. A master file runs all of the code to generate the data for the two figures and one table in the paper. The replicator should expect the code to run for about 2 minutes, divided into 0.5 minutes in the cleaning, 1 minute in the construction, and 0.5 minutes in the analysis. A specific time for all individual scripts is reported in CSV files with the prefix `"_timeProcessing_"` in each code folder. All the data is provided, from raw to final, including intermediate, so it is possible to skip any individual script.

Description of Files Structure 
----------------------------

- `"README.md"`:  This document. A markdown file to generate `"README.pdf"` and `"README.html"` (best for reading). It provides the necessary information about the structure of the replication folder, data sources, data access, and computational requirements. It ultimately explains how to replicate the analysis presented in the paper entirely.
 
- `"code`: a folder containing all scripts to clean, build, merge, and analyze the data
  - `"code/MASTERFILE.R"`: R script to run all scripts from data cleaning to generating the results;
  - `"code/setup.R"`: R script to install/load R packages and configure the initial setup. Uses `"groundhog"` to keep all packages version fixed at the specified date (2023-05-06);
  - `"code/raw2clean"`: R scripts that clean the data on input and save on the output for each dataset;
  - `"code/projectSpecific"`: R scripts that construct the samples for analysis;
  - `"code/analysis" `: R scripts to generate the results presented in the paper (statistics, figures, and tables);
  - `"code/_functions"`: auxiliary folder with custom R function used in multiple R scripts to export the processing time.

- `"data"`: a folder containing data in a variety of formats: raw, cleaned, intermediate, final datasets for analysis, and analysis outputs
  - `"data/raw2clean"`: one folder for each dataset with the following structure:
    - `"/input"`: folder with raw datasets; 
    - `"/output"`: folder with the cleaned dataset; 
    - `"/documentation" `: folder with at least two files: 
      - `"_metadata.txt"` text file that describes the data and provides access instructions;
      - `"codebook_datasetName.txt"` text file with summary statistics and variables description.
  - `"data/projectSpecific"`: folder with the samples for analysis and intermediate datasets:
    - `"/muniLevel"`: folder with the samples of interest at the *municipality level*.
  - `"data/analysis" `: folder with all regression outputs in `"/regressions" `;
  - `"data/_temp"`: folder to hold temporary files output (filled when running some .R scripts).

- `"products"`: a folder with (this folder is generally omitted when sending a replication package to a journal):
  - `"/aux_files"`: auxiliary files for the paper and slides output;
  - `"/paper"`: a folder with the LaTeX paper template separated into the main paper and appendix;
  - `"/aux_files"`: a folder with the R Markdown beamer slides template for a presentation and the preliminary results (only figures and tables).

- `"references"`: folder with three BibTeX files to record all references for citation (literature: `"references_literature.bib"`, data: `"references_data.bib"`, and software: `"references_software.bib"`) and one subfolder to store the references PDFs (`"references_pdf"`).

- `"results"`: folder with the main results used in the paper
  - `"figures"`: folder with all figures. The figures of the main paper are listed in `"figures.tex"`. The figures of the appendix are listed in `"figures_appendix.tex"`;
  - `"tables"`: folder with all tables. The tables of the main paper are listed in `"tables.tex"`. The tables of the appendix are listed in `"tables_appendix.tex"`;
  - `"stats"`: folder with the log output from the R script that calculates all the statistics cited in the text `"supportingStats.txt"`.

- `"reproducible_paper_example2.Rproj"`: R project to automatically adjust file path references. Always open RStudio from this file when running any R script.

- `"LICENSE.txt"`: a text file with a dual-license setup.

Computational requirements
---------------------------

### Software Requirements

- R (code was last run with version 4.3.0 (2023-04-21 ucrt))
  - the file `"code/setup.R"` will install/load R packages and configure the initial setup. It uses the R package `"groundhog"` (version 3.1.0) to keep all package versions fixed at the specified date (2023-05-06). It also uses `knitr::write_bib` to record all R packages as software citations in a BibTeX file `"references/references_software.bib"`. It is automatically sourced within any .R script in the project.
  - the file `"reproducible_paper_example2.Rproj"` will guarantee that the working directory is set to the root of the project (always open RStudio using this file).
  - List of R packages: 
    - groundhog (version 3.1.0) [@R-groundhog] 
    - conflicted (version 1.2.0) [@R-conflicted]
    - Hmisc (version 5.0-1) [@R-Hmisc]
    - sjlabelled (version 1.2.0) [@R-sjlabelled]
    - tidyverse (version 2.0.0) [@R-tidyverse]
    - sf (version 1.0-12) [@R-sf]
    - rmarkdown (version 2.21) [@R-rmarkdown]
    - tictoc (version 1.2) [@R-tictoc]
    - here (version 1.0.1) [@R-here]
    - tinytex (version 0.45) [@R-tinytex]
    - janitor (version 2.2.0) [@R-janitor]
    - did (version 2.1.2) [@R-did]
    - kableExtra (version 1.3.4) [@R-kableExtra]
    - modelsummary (version 1.4.0) [@R-modelsummary]
    - tabulizer (version 0.2.2) [@R-tabulizer]


### Memory and Runtime Requirements

#### Summary

Approximate time needed to reproduce the analyses on a standard (CURRENT YEAR) desktop machine:

- [X] <10 minutes

#### Details

The code was last run on an **8-core Desktop; Intel Core i7-2600 CPU @ 3.40 GHz processor; 32GB RAM; Windows 10 Pro**. 

The total disk size (expected) to be consumed by the project considering everything (including intermediate dataset, libraries, etc.) in an uncompressed format is approximately 541MB (~634 files). 

Description of programs/code
----------------------------

- `"code/_MASTERFILE.R"` will run individual master files for each folder: 
  - `"code/raw2clean/masterfile_raw2clean.R"` will run one R script to clean each input dataset (4 scripts).
  - `"code/projectSpecific/muniLevel/masterfile_projectSpecific.R"` will construct the base sample, extract the information from each dataset relevant to this paper, construct the variables of interest, merge them with the base sample, and generate the sample for analysis in multiple formats: panel and spatial (4 scripts).
  - `"code/analysis/masterfile_analysis.R"` will run the regressions and generate all supporting statistics, tables, and figures (5 scripts).

### License for Code 

The code is licensed under a Modified BSD License. See [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) for details.

Instructions to Replicators
---------------------------

- (Only in the first time)  Download the replication package.
- (Only in the first time)  Download R 4.3.0 (strongly recommended).
- Open RStudio using `"reproducible_paper_example2.Rproj"` to set the working directory to the project root.
- (Only in the first time) Run `"code/setup.R"` to install all the necessary R packages with the same version as when it was last run.
  - `"groundhog"` might give the following message `"IMPORTANT. R does not have a personal library to save packages to. The default location for it is: 'C:\Users\username\AppData\Local/R/win-library/4.3'. 1) Type 'create' to create that directory 2) Otherwise type 'stop'"`. Answer with `create` in the console to proceed;
  - Package `tabulizer` might require installing Java 64-bits (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17376939/problems-when-trying-to-load-a-package-in-r-due-to-rjava)
  - In some cases Rtools might be necessary (https://groundhogr.com/rtools/);
  - In some cases re-running the script might solve possible installation issues.
- Run `"code/MASTERFILE.R"` to run all R scripts in sequence.
  - Skipping individual R programs will not prevent others from running correctly because all intermediate datasets are available. However, you should manually adjust the folder-specific master files to remove the scripts you do not want to run.
- If you want to re-compile the .tex and .Rmd files in the products folder you might need to do the following:
  - In Tools > Project Options... > Sweave > select `pdfLaTeX` for Typset LaTeX;
  - If there is already a LaTeX distribution installed but rendering .tex and .Rmd files is not working, a possible solution is to install the same tinytex version as used in the template `tinytex::install_tinytex(version = "2023.05")`;
  - If you encounter missing package errors when compiling to pdf a useful solution is to run `tinytex::parse_install(here::here("products/paper/main_paper.log"))` in R (substituting the file name and path with the relevant for your case).

List of tables and programs
---------------------------

The provided code reproduces:

- [X] All numbers provided in text in the paper
